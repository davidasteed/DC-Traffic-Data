DC-Traffic-Data project:

David Steed, developer
The Iron Yard Feb 2017 Cohort

Synopsis:  using node.js server-side programming, read in traffic data files (.csv files) and analyze as requested by the customer.

Critical path:

1.  validate that the input file can be read into a buffer, then to a big string object, then to an array of strings, then to an array of array of strings. (parse.js)
  done
2.  validate that parse.js can be exported and run remotely
  done
3.  TODO:  map out the program flow and relationship of the .js files:
  a.  main.js calls what?  then what? etc.
